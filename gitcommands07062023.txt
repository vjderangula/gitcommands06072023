Reset, restore and revert
There are three commands with similar names: git reset, git restore and git revert.

git-revert[1] is about making a new commit that reverts the changes made by other commits.

git-restore[1] is about restoring files in the working tree from either the index or another commit. This command does not update your branch. The command can also be used to restore files in the index from another commit.

git-reset[1] is about updating your branch, moving the tip in order to add or remove commits from the branch. This operation changes the commit history.

git reset can also be used to restore the index, overlapping with git restore.

Low-level commands (plumbing)
Although Git includes its own porcelain layer, its low-level commands are sufficient to support development of alternative porcelains. Developers of such porcelains might start by reading about git-update-index[1] and git-read-tree[1].

The interface (input, output, set of options and the semantics) to these low-level commands are meant to be a lot more stable than Porcelain level commands, because these commands are primarily for scripted use. The interface to Porcelain commands on the other hand are subject to change in order to improve the end user experience.

The following description divides the low-level commands into commands that manipulate objects (in the repository, index, and working tree), commands that interrogate and compare objects, and commands that move objects and references between repositories.

Configuration Mechanism
Git uses a simple text format to store customizations that are per repository and are per user. Such a configuration file may look like this:

#
# A '#' or ';' character indicates a comment.
#

; core variables
[core]
	; Don't trust file modes
	filemode = false

; user identity
[user]
	name = "Junio C Hamano"
	email = "gitster@pobox.com"
Various commands read from the configuration file and adjust their operation accordingly. See git-config[1] for a list and more details about the configuration mechanism.

Identifier Terminology
<object>
Indicates the object name for any type of object.

<blob>
Indicates a blob object name.

<tree>
Indicates a tree object name.

<commit>
Indicates a commit object name.

<tree-ish>
Indicates a tree, commit or tag object name. A command that takes a <tree-ish> argument ultimately wants to operate on a <tree> object but automatically dereferences <commit> and <tag> objects that point at a <tree>.

<commit-ish>
Indicates a commit or tag object name. A command that takes a <commit-ish> argument ultimately wants to operate on a <commit> object but automatically dereferences <tag> objects that point at a <commit>.

<type>
Indicates that an object type is required. Currently one of: blob, tree, commit, or tag.

<file>
Indicates a filename - almost always relative to the root of the tree structure GIT_INDEX_FILE describes.

Symbolic Identifiers
Any Git command accepting any <object> can also use the following symbolic notation:

HEAD
indicates the head of the current branch.

<tag>
a valid tag name (i.e. a refs/tags/<tag> reference).

<head>
a valid head name (i.e. a refs/heads/<head> reference).

For a more complete list of ways to spell object names, see "SPECIFYING REVISIONS" section in gitrevisions[7].

File/Directory Structure
Please see the gitrepository-layout[5] document.

Read githooks[5] for more details about each hook.

Higher level SCMs may provide and manage additional information in the $GIT_DIR.

Terminology
Please see gitglossary[7].

Environment Variables
Various Git commands pay attention to environment variables and change their behavior. The environment variables marked as "Boolean" take their values the same way as Boolean valued configuration variables, e.g. "true", "yes", "on" and positive numbers are taken as "yes".

Here are the variables:

The Git Repository
These environment variables apply to all core Git commands. Nb: it is worth noting that they may be used/overridden by SCMS sitting above Git so take care if using a foreign front-end.

GIT_INDEX_FILE
This environment variable specifies an alternate index file. If not specified, the default of $GIT_DIR/index is used.

GIT_INDEX_VERSION
This environment variable specifies what index version is used when writing the index file out. It won’t affect existing index files. By default index file version 2 or 3 is used. See git-update-index[1] for more information.

GIT_OBJECT_DIRECTORY
If the object storage directory is specified via this environment variable then the sha1 directories are created underneath - otherwise the default $GIT_DIR/objects directory is used.

GIT_ALTERNATE_OBJECT_DIRECTORIES
Due to the immutable nature of Git objects, old objects can be archived into shared, read-only directories. This variable specifies a ":" separated (on Windows ";" separated) list of Git object directories which can be used to search for Git objects. New objects will not be written to these directories.

Entries that begin with " (double-quote) will be interpreted as C-style quoted paths, removing leading and trailing double-quotes and respecting backslash escapes. E.g., the value "path-with-\"-and-:-in-it":vanilla-path has two paths: path-with-"-and-:-in-it and vanilla-path.

GIT_DIR
If the GIT_DIR environment variable is set then it specifies a path to use instead of the default .git for the base of the repository. The --git-dir command-line option also sets this value.

GIT_WORK_TREE
Set the path to the root of the working tree. This can also be controlled by the --work-tree command-line option and the core.worktree configuration variable.

GIT_NAMESPACE
Set the Git namespace; see gitnamespaces[7] for details. The --namespace command-line option also sets this value.

GIT_CEILING_DIRECTORIES
This should be a colon-separated list of absolute paths. If set, it is a list of directories that Git should not chdir up into while looking for a repository directory (useful for excluding slow-loading network directories). It will not exclude the current working directory or a GIT_DIR set on the command line or in the environment. Normally, Git has to read the entries in this list and resolve any symlink that might be present in order to compare them with the current directory. However, if even this access is slow, you can add an empty entry to the list to tell Git that the subsequent entries are not symlinks and needn’t be resolved; e.g., GIT_CEILING_DIRECTORIES=/maybe/symlink::/very/slow/non/symlink.

GIT_DISCOVERY_ACROSS_FILESYSTEM
When run in a directory that does not have ".git" repository directory, Git tries to find such a directory in the parent directories to find the top of the working tree, but by default it does not cross filesystem boundaries. This Boolean environment variable can be set to true to tell Git not to stop at filesystem boundaries. Like GIT_CEILING_DIRECTORIES, this will not affect an explicit repository directory set via GIT_DIR or on the command line.

GIT_COMMON_DIR
If this variable is set to a path, non-worktree files that are normally in $GIT_DIR will be taken from this path instead. Worktree-specific files such as HEAD or index are taken from $GIT_DIR. See gitrepository-layout[5] and git-worktree[1] for details. This variable has lower precedence than other path variables such as GIT_INDEX_FILE, GIT_OBJECT_DIRECTORY…​

GIT_DEFAULT_HASH
If this variable is set, the default hash algorithm for new repositories will be set to this value. This value is ignored when cloning and the setting of the remote repository is always used. The default is "sha1". THIS VARIABLE IS EXPERIMENTAL! See --object-format in git-init[1].

Git Commits
GIT_AUTHOR_NAME
The human-readable name used in the author identity when creating commit or tag objects, or when writing reflogs. Overrides the user.name and author.name configuration settings.

GIT_AUTHOR_EMAIL
The email address used in the author identity when creating commit or tag objects, or when writing reflogs. Overrides the user.email and author.email configuration settings.

GIT_AUTHOR_DATE
The date used for the author identity when creating commit or tag objects, or when writing reflogs. See git-commit[1] for valid formats.

GIT_COMMITTER_NAME
The human-readable name used in the committer identity when creating commit or tag objects, or when writing reflogs. Overrides the user.name and committer.name configuration settings.

GIT_COMMITTER_EMAIL
The email address used in the author identity when creating commit or tag objects, or when writing reflogs. Overrides the user.email and committer.email configuration settings.

GIT_COMMITTER_DATE
The date used for the committer identity when creating commit or tag objects, or when writing reflogs. See git-commit[1] for valid formats.

EMAIL
The email address used in the author and committer identities if no other relevant environment variable or configuration setting has been set.

Git Diffs
GIT_DIFF_OPTS
Only valid setting is "--unified=??" or "-u??" to set the number of context lines shown when a unified diff is created. This takes precedence over any "-U" or "--unified" option value passed on the Git diff command line.

GIT_EXTERNAL_DIFF
When the environment variable GIT_EXTERNAL_DIFF is set, the program named by it is called to generate diffs, and Git does not use its builtin diff machinery. For a path that is added, removed, or modified, GIT_EXTERNAL_DIFF is called with 7 parameters:

path old-file old-hex old-mode new-file new-hex new-mode
where:

<old|new>-file
are files GIT_EXTERNAL_DIFF can use to read the contents of <old|new>,

<old|new>-hex
are the 40-hexdigit SHA-1 hashes,

<old|new>-mode
are the octal representation of the file modes.

The file parameters can point at the user’s working file (e.g. new-file in "git-diff-files"), /dev/null (e.g. old-file when a new file is added), or a temporary file (e.g. old-file in the index). GIT_EXTERNAL_DIFF should not worry about unlinking the temporary file — it is removed when GIT_EXTERNAL_DIFF exits.

For a path that is unmerged, GIT_EXTERNAL_DIFF is called with 1 parameter, <path>.

For each path GIT_EXTERNAL_DIFF is called, two environment variables, GIT_DIFF_PATH_COUNTER and GIT_DIFF_PATH_TOTAL are set.

GIT_DIFF_PATH_COUNTER
A 1-based counter incremented by one for every path.

GIT_DIFF_PATH_TOTAL
The total number of paths.

other
GIT_MERGE_VERBOSITY
A number controlling the amount of output shown by the recursive merge strategy. Overrides merge.verbosity. See git-merge[1]

GIT_PAGER
This environment variable overrides $PAGER. If it is set to an empty string or to the value "cat", Git will not launch a pager. See also the core.pager option in git-config[1].

GIT_PROGRESS_DELAY
A number controlling how many seconds to delay before showing optional progress indicators. Defaults to 2.

GIT_EDITOR
This environment variable overrides $EDITOR and $VISUAL. It is used by several Git commands when, on interactive mode, an editor is to be launched. See also git-var[1] and the core.editor option in git-config[1].

GIT_SEQUENCE_EDITOR
This environment variable overrides the configured Git editor when editing the todo list of an interactive rebase. See also git-rebase[1] and the sequence.editor option in git-config[1].

GIT_SSH
GIT_SSH_COMMAND
If either of these environment variables is set then git fetch and git push will use the specified command instead of ssh when they need to connect to a remote system. The command-line parameters passed to the configured command are determined by the ssh variant. See ssh.variant option in git-config[1] for details.

$GIT_SSH_COMMAND takes precedence over $GIT_SSH, and is interpreted by the shell, which allows additional arguments to be included. $GIT_SSH on the other hand must be just the path to a program (which can be a wrapper shell script, if additional arguments are needed).

Usually it is easier to configure any desired options through your personal .ssh/config file. Please consult your ssh documentation for further details.

GIT_SSH_VARIANT
If this environment variable is set, it overrides Git’s autodetection whether GIT_SSH/GIT_SSH_COMMAND/core.sshCommand refer to OpenSSH, plink or tortoiseplink. This variable overrides the config setting ssh.variant that serves the same purpose.

GIT_SSL_NO_VERIFY
Setting and exporting this environment variable to any value tells Git not to verify the SSL certificate when fetching or pushing over HTTPS.

GIT_ATTR_SOURCE
Sets the treeish that gitattributes will be read from.

GIT_ASKPASS
If this environment variable is set, then Git commands which need to acquire passwords or passphrases (e.g. for HTTP or IMAP authentication) will call this program with a suitable prompt as command-line argument and read the password from its STDOUT. See also the core.askPass option in git-config[1].

GIT_TERMINAL_PROMPT
If this Boolean environment variable is set to false, git will not prompt on the terminal (e.g., when asking for HTTP authentication).

GIT_CONFIG_GLOBAL
GIT_CONFIG_SYSTEM
Take the configuration from the given files instead from global or system-level configuration files. If GIT_CONFIG_SYSTEM is set, the system config file defined at build time (usually /etc/gitconfig) will not be read. Likewise, if GIT_CONFIG_GLOBAL is set, neither $HOME/.gitconfig nor $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/git/config will be read. Can be set to /dev/null to skip reading configuration files of the respective level.

GIT_CONFIG_NOSYSTEM
Whether to skip reading settings from the system-wide $(prefix)/etc/gitconfig file. This Boolean environment variable can be used along with $HOME and $XDG_CONFIG_HOME to create a predictable environment for a picky script, or you can set it to true to temporarily avoid using a buggy /etc/gitconfig file while waiting for someone with sufficient permissions to fix it.

GIT_FLUSH
If this environment variable is set to "1", then commands such as git blame (in incremental mode), git rev-list, git log, git check-attr and git check-ignore will force a flush of the output stream after each record have been flushed. If this variable is set to "0", the output of these commands will be done using completely buffered I/O. If this environment variable is not set, Git will choose buffered or record-oriented flushing based on whether stdout appears to be redirected to a file or not.

GIT_TRACE
Enables general trace messages, e.g. alias expansion, built-in command execution and external command execution.

If this variable is set to "1", "2" or "true" (comparison is case insensitive), trace messages will be printed to stderr.

If the variable is set to an integer value greater than 2 and lower than 10 (strictly) then Git will interpret this value as an open file descriptor and will try to write the trace messages into this file descriptor.

Alternatively, if the variable is set to an absolute path (starting with a / character), Git will interpret this as a file path and will try to append the trace messages to it.

Unsetting the variable, or setting it to empty, "0" or "false" (case insensitive) disables trace messages.

GIT_TRACE_FSMONITOR
Enables trace messages for the filesystem monitor extension. See GIT_TRACE for available trace output options.

GIT_TRACE_PACK_ACCESS
Enables trace messages for all accesses to any packs. For each access, the pack file name and an offset in the pack is recorded. This may be helpful for troubleshooting some pack-related performance problems. See GIT_TRACE for available trace output options.

GIT_TRACE_PACKET
Enables trace messages for all packets coming in or out of a given program. This can help with debugging object negotiation or other protocol issues. Tracing is turned off at a packet starting with "PACK" (but see GIT_TRACE_PACKFILE below). See GIT_TRACE for available trace output options.

GIT_TRACE_PACKFILE
Enables tracing of packfiles sent or received by a given program. Unlike other trace output, this trace is verbatim: no headers, and no quoting of binary data. You almost certainly want to direct into a file (e.g., GIT_TRACE_PACKFILE=/tmp/my.pack) rather than displaying it on the terminal or mixing it with other trace output.

Note that this is currently only implemented for the client side of clones and fetches.

GIT_TRACE_PERFORMANCE
Enables performance related trace messages, e.g. total execution time of each Git command. See GIT_TRACE for available trace output options.

GIT_TRACE_REFS
Enables trace messages for operations on the ref database. See GIT_TRACE for available trace output options.

GIT_TRACE_SETUP
Enables trace messages printing the .git, working tree and current working directory after Git has completed its setup phase. See GIT_TRACE for available trace output options.

GIT_TRACE_SHALLOW
Enables trace messages that can help debugging fetching / cloning of shallow repositories. See GIT_TRACE for available trace output options.

GIT_TRACE_CURL
Enables a curl full trace dump of all incoming and outgoing data, including descriptive information, of the git transport protocol. This is similar to doing curl --trace-ascii on the command line. See GIT_TRACE for available trace output options.

GIT_TRACE_CURL_NO_DATA
When a curl trace is enabled (see GIT_TRACE_CURL above), do not dump data (that is, only dump info lines and headers).

GIT_TRACE2
Enables more detailed trace messages from the "trace2" library. Output from GIT_TRACE2 is a simple text-based format for human readability.

If this variable is set to "1", "2" or "true" (comparison is case insensitive), trace messages will be printed to stderr.

If the variable is set to an integer value greater than 2 and lower than 10 (strictly) then Git will interpret this value as an open file descriptor and will try to write the trace messages into this file descriptor.

Alternatively, if the variable is set to an absolute path (starting with a / character), Git will interpret this as a file path and will try to append the trace messages to it. If the path already exists and is a directory, the trace messages will be written to files (one per process) in that directory, named according to the last component of the SID and an optional counter (to avoid filename collisions).

In addition, if the variable is set to af_unix:[<socket_type>:]<absolute-pathname>, Git will try to open the path as a Unix Domain Socket. The socket type can be either stream or dgram.

Unsetting the variable, or setting it to empty, "0" or "false" (case insensitive) disables trace messages.

See Trace2 documentation for full details.

GIT_TRACE2_EVENT
This setting writes a JSON-based format that is suited for machine interpretation. See GIT_TRACE2 for available trace output options and Trace2 documentation for full details.

GIT_TRACE2_PERF
In addition to the text-based messages available in GIT_TRACE2, this setting writes a column-based format for understanding nesting regions. See GIT_TRACE2 for available trace output options and Trace2 documentation for full details.

GIT_TRACE_REDACT
By default, when tracing is activated, Git redacts the values of cookies, the "Authorization:" header, the "Proxy-Authorization:" header and packfile URIs. Set this Boolean environment variable to false to prevent this redaction.

GIT_LITERAL_PATHSPECS
Setting this Boolean environment variable to true will cause Git to treat all pathspecs literally, rather than as glob patterns. For example, running GIT_LITERAL_PATHSPECS=1 git log -- '*.c' will search for commits that touch the path *.c, not any paths that the glob *.c matches. You might want this if you are feeding literal paths to Git (e.g., paths previously given to you by git ls-tree, --raw diff output, etc).

GIT_GLOB_PATHSPECS
Setting this Boolean environment variable to true will cause Git to treat all pathspecs as glob patterns (aka "glob" magic).

GIT_NOGLOB_PATHSPECS
Setting this Boolean environment variable to true will cause Git to treat all pathspecs as literal (aka "literal" magic).

GIT_ICASE_PATHSPECS
Setting this Boolean environment variable to true will cause Git to treat all pathspecs as case-insensitive.

GIT_REFLOG_ACTION
When a ref is updated, reflog entries are created to keep track of the reason why the ref was updated (which is typically the name of the high-level command that updated the ref), in addition to the old and new values of the ref. A scripted Porcelain command can use set_reflog_action helper function in git-sh-setup to set its name to this variable when it is invoked as the top level command by the end user, to be recorded in the body of the reflog.

GIT_REF_PARANOIA
If this Boolean environment variable is set to false, ignore broken or badly named refs when iterating over lists of refs. Normally Git will try to include any such refs, which may cause some operations to fail. This is usually preferable, as potentially destructive operations (e.g., git-prune[1]) are better off aborting rather than ignoring broken refs (and thus considering the history they point to as not worth saving). The default value is 1 (i.e., be paranoid about detecting and aborting all operations). You should not normally need to set this to 0, but it may be useful when trying to salvage data from a corrupted repository.

GIT_ALLOW_PROTOCOL
If set to a colon-separated list of protocols, behave as if protocol.allow is set to never, and each of the listed protocols has protocol.<name>.allow set to always (overriding any existing configuration). See the description of protocol.allow in git-config[1] for more details.

GIT_PROTOCOL_FROM_USER
Set this Boolean environment variable to false to prevent protocols used by fetch/push/clone which are configured to the user state. This is useful to restrict recursive submodule initialization from an untrusted repository or for programs which feed potentially-untrusted URLS to git commands. See git-config[1] for more details.

GIT_PROTOCOL
For internal use only. Used in handshaking the wire protocol. Contains a colon : separated list of keys with optional values key[=value]. Presence of unknown keys and values must be ignored.

Note that servers may need to be configured to allow this variable to pass over some transports. It will be propagated automatically when accessing local repositories (i.e., file:// or a filesystem path), as well as over the git:// protocol. For git-over-http, it should work automatically in most configurations, but see the discussion in git-http-backend[1]. For git-over-ssh, the ssh server may need to be configured to allow clients to pass this variable (e.g., by using AcceptEnv GIT_PROTOCOL with OpenSSH).

This configuration is optional. If the variable is not propagated, then clients will fall back to the original "v0" protocol (but may miss out on some performance improvements or features). This variable currently only affects clones and fetches; it is not yet used for pushes (but may be in the future).

GIT_OPTIONAL_LOCKS
If this Boolean environment variable is set to false, Git will complete any requested operation without performing any optional sub-operations that require taking a lock. For example, this will prevent git status from refreshing the index as a side effect. This is useful for processes running in the background which do not want to cause lock contention with other operations on the repository. Defaults to 1.

GIT_REDIRECT_STDIN
GIT_REDIRECT_STDOUT
GIT_REDIRECT_STDERR
Windows-only: allow redirecting the standard input/output/error handles to paths specified by the environment variables. This is particularly useful in multi-threaded applications where the canonical way to pass standard handles via CreateProcess() is not an option because it would require the handles to be marked inheritable (and consequently every spawned process would inherit them, possibly blocking regular Git operations). The primary intended use case is to use named pipes for communication (e.g. \\.\pipe\my-git-stdin-123).

Two special values are supported: off will simply close the corresponding standard handle, and if GIT_REDIRECT_STDERR is 2>&1, standard error will be redirected to the same handle as standard output.

GIT_PRINT_SHA1_ELLIPSIS (deprecated)
If set to yes, print an ellipsis following an (abbreviated) SHA-1 value. This affects indications of detached HEADs (git-checkout[1]) and the raw diff output (git-diff[1]). Printing an ellipsis in the cases mentioned is no longer considered adequate and support for it is likely to be removed in the foreseeable future (along with the variable).
